## Modding
Beanulator is a project extremely reliant on the community, we want it to be expanded by the community too! Here's some tips on how you can add your ideas as extensions to the game.

### Installing a Mod
First of all, installing a mod is fairly easy. In Nuclear's words, it's easier than installing a Minecraft mod. All you need to do is take the AssetBundle(s) and the corresponding manifest(s) provided by the modder and put it in the persistent storage. See the table below for where persistent storage is located on your platform.

| Platform | Path                                                                 |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows  | `%userprofile%\AppData\LocalLow\Decaffeinated Studios\Beanulator 3D` |
| Linux    | `~/.config/unity3d/Decaffeinated Studios/Beanulator 3D`              |
| MacOS    | `~/Library/Application Support/Decaffeinated Studios/Beanulator 3D`  |

### Making a Mod
Making one isn't super hard either: on the modder version there's a button that exports the AssetBundle. Use any existing Assets as examples, and build your mod from there!

## Relation to Killer Bean
"Wait a minute," you might be asking. "Those beans remind me of the ones from Killer Bean 2.1!"
That's because it's where they were originally from. (Hold on, before you file a copyright infringement complaint, read below!)

Killer Bean is a wonderful series created by Jeff Lew that follows a bean assassin named Killer Bean. We loved every bit of it, and were inspired to create a 3D video game. 
We started work on the game, but realized it would be inconsiderate towards Mr. Lew: he spent years working on it, and it would be completely unfair to steal it from him. 
While still keeping the beans' luxurious designs, we removed as much resemblance to Killer Bean as possible.
This is also why we won't include distinct things from the series.

### The Most Important Person
[Nuclear_diamond](https://discord.com/users/nuclears_user_id) made Beanulator what it is today. He was the only one who was actually proficient in Unity, and he did at least 99% of the technical stuff. In addition, he made the project specifically in a way that others could still add on after he laid the groundwork.

This project wouldn't be possible without him.
