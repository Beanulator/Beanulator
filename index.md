## Modding
Beanulator is a project extremely reliant on the community, we want it to be expanded by the community too! Here's some tips on how you can add your ideas as extensions to the game.

### Where to Find and Distribute Mods
Endorsed mods can be found on the [mods branch](https://github.com/Decaffeinated-Studios/Beanulator/tree/mods) of our public tracker. A description will be included in a README for each.     
Have a mod you want endorsed? Make a pull request to add it! More often than not, we'll be happy to do so. 

### Installing a Mod
First of all, installing a mod is fairly easy. In Nuclear's words, it's easier than installing a Minecraft mod. All you need to do is take the AssetBundle(s) and the corresponding manifest(s) provided by the modder and put it in the persistent storage. See the table below for where persistent storage is located on your platform. (If you're an epic gamer and are using the command line to copy it there, note that you need backslashes (\\) in front of each space.)

| Platform | Path                                                                  |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows  | `%userprofile%\AppData\LocalLow\Decaffeinated Studios\Beanulator 3D`  |
| Linux    | `~/.config/unity3d/Decaffeinated Studios/Beanulator 3D`               |
| MacOS    | `~/Library/Application Support/com.DecaffeinatedStudios.Beanulator3D` |

You can ensure your mod has been installed by checking settings in Beanulator. Clicking the `Mods` button in Beanulator settings will show a list of all mods installed.

### Making a Mod
Full moding instructions can be found at [mod-tutorial.pdf](https://beanulator.tk/mod-tutorial.pdf).
In addition, the modder version can be found [here](https://beanulator.tk/Beanulator3D-ModMakerPackage.zip). This is hosted here rather than the GitHub release because it's not part of the core game and we don't want too many assets.   
Note: the PDF says that Beanulator uses Unity version 2020.3, which is incorrect: the game is developed using Unity 2020.2.0f1. This is the final version of Unity 2020.2.0. This probably doesn't affect anything, but if you're experiencing issues switching to that version may help.

## Relation to Killer Bean
"Wait a minute," you might be asking. "Those beans remind me of the ones from Killer Bean 2.1!"
That's because it's where they were originally from. (Hold on, before you file a copyright infringement complaint, read below!)

Killer Bean is a wonderful series created by Jeff Lew that follows a bean assassin named Killer Bean. We loved every bit of it, and were inspired to create a 3D video game. 
We started work on the game, but realized it would be inconsiderate towards Mr. Lew: he spent years working on it, and it would be completely unfair to steal it from him. 
While still keeping the beans' luxurious designs, we removed as much resemblance to Killer Bean as possible.
This is also why we won't include distinct things from the series.

### The Most Important Person
[Nuclear_diamond](https://discord.com/users/560210323261620243) made Beanulator what it is today. He was the only one who was actually proficient in Unity, and he did at least 99% of the technical stuff. In addition, he made the project specifically in a way that others could still add on after he laid the groundwork.

This project wouldn't be possible without him.
